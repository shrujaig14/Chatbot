"What should I do after an MSc in mathematics? Can I do a PhD from IISc Bangalore? I'm born on 25 May 2002 at 9:30 am in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.","After maths honours there are various options and fields which are open.Talking about teaching specifically , you have MSc and B.Ed. if you do B.Ed after bsc then you can just be a tgt teacher in school whereas if you do Msc and B.Ed then you can become a pgt teacher.Doing MSc after Bsc is more preferable as the concepts are fresh in your mind.I have made a detailed video on career options after maths , teaching career after bsc and a complete Detailed series on BSc Maths honours on my YouTube Channel : Ayushi Gupta Live!Just search this channel name."
How can I do BSc Mathematics (major) through IGNOU?,"Hi Rahul I hope you are fine and healthy,so you want to know about Mathematics elective selection process.Steps are:-(1) If you want BSc Major in Mathematics then you have to choose minimum 40 credits worth of Mathematics electives(2)you have to choose/opt your Mathematics electives according to year wise scheme i.e some electives in first year,some in second year and rest are in third year.(3) Remember you cannot opt a 3rd year elective course in first year or second year but you can opt first year course in second year or third year similar a second year course in the third year that is why you are getting less than of 24 credit options of Mathematics electives.(4)Since you are using online reregistration system and this system has capability to eliminate already choosen elective course/courses by you that is why you are not getting MTE1 or MTE6 etc. options in your second year reregistration options list.** Visit my blog Qurociti for more updates on various academic topics."

"Which is better, BSC chemistry honours or BSC mathematics honours after +2?","Too many variables here. Your point of interest,what do u wanna be later in life,where u wanna study. So giving a generic answer. Studying chemistry honours is a good thing if u want to continue in that field later. I have a friend who topped her university in chemistry honours from CU but then is doing an MBA. But doing BSC in Maths leaves scope for more options after graduation. But let me remind you that BSc Maths isnt really similar to 12th standard maths and there will be surprises and WILL be very difficult . But then you can pursue several fields in Maths later and also can do MCA. But primarily,answer the following questions for a better reply.1. Your subject of interest.(irrespective of the marks u got)2. Do you want to go into corporate or research or academics later in life?3.Which state are you from?4. Have you scored enough to get into the top institutions? (Dont have to reveal your marks or details)"
How good is the CMI BSc. Mathematics and Physics course?,"Disclaimer: As clear from my bio, I only took one compulsory semester of Physics at CMI (Classical Mechanics I, which I loved) since I am a Math+CS student.Very few of my classmates who have opted for Physics came here to study Physics; whereas, the Math+CS section has both Math and CS enthusiasts in significant proportion. Physics is a popular choice for the second subject for Maths students who are uncomfortable with CS due to prior inexperience/are under the impression that it brings better grades. Whether any of this is logical or true I do not know! Of course, there are people who have interest and experience in both Physics and CS and choose Physics for some reason.However, the (mostly) same people who taught Physics before are still teaching Physics in the Math/Physics course. Kids have gained an interest in Physics after taking it, and switched over from Math (as have many Math+CS kids switched from Math to CS). They, along with the few who came here to primarily study Physics, have done no less well in life than the oldies who studied the pure Physics degree. My batch-mates from the Physics section are not hating it, if not liking it. Everyone is definitely fond of Classical Mechanics II by Prof. Govind Krishnaswami, as the Anon below (who I am currently attempting to identify :P) says. (His/her opinion on Math, btw, will be unpopular among our pure Math nerds).A former student of my acquaintance did the pure Physics degree and is now in Germany. His profs are now teaching my Math+Physics friends. If you do not mind studying Math as deeply as you study Physics, you are definitely in good hands here. Be warned though, that the Math courses are pretty demanding and cannot be ignored if you want your degree!"
What is the cutoff percentage for BSC mathematics in Christ University?,"I was a commerce student in my 10+2 and got a mere 60% in maths as a commerce student.I am now doing BSc in Christ University with maths as one of my majors and I didn't have to struggle for this. I got my first preference. :)Hope this gives you an insight into the ""cut-offs"""
What do most of the students studying BSc Mathematics at CMI end up doing in their life as career?,"Short answer: a PhD. Hehe.Not all students here come primarily for Math. The degree is compulsorily dual, with compulsory courses in both Math/CS or Math/Physics upto the second year. There exist people who are focussed on the other part (CS/Physics) from the beginning. Since you ask about sticking to Math, I omit them from this answer hereafter.A good number of kids have no idea what real Mathematics is like, since high school maths is at least 50% applicative and has little to no abstraction. Some develop a taste for it, in their previously favourite field or another field; others do an MSc in Applied Mathematics instead of pure Mathematics. Often they shift to the job sector (or not). Others shift to CS/Physics, and have sterling careers in it. The Math sticklers dominate, but among them the pure:applied ratio varies.Even some Math Olympiad kids are tripped up by abstraction beyond a certain point ('tricks' no longer work, as a professor quipped once), or simply get interested in CS/Physics more. They too have great careers if they work for it.CMI students mostly do a PhD eventually, irrespective of subject. Some go through an MSc while others skip it, each path having pros and cons, which is a whole different Quora question (which exists, you may want to read those answers). For CMI undergrads it is best to not take too hasty a decision about the future career path, and to take in all compulsory courses with an open mind before picking their favourite electives.Oh, and, if you are a concerned parent or something, with latent questions about the earning prospects, don't worry. They'll live. Comfortably, or maybe even better. Post-MSc, you can expect financial independence via a job or a doctoral programme. Post-PhD, they have good prospects in academia, given they work, of course. The CMI website has some placement history. You could look at it!"

Why don't more people study bsc Statistics?,"Its the Lack of Awareness and course option among school students. In General school students are categorised into 3 streams. Commerce, Computer Science and Biology. So students obviously tend to think either they can become a doctor or engineer or to enter management aspect.I am basically from Commerce background with economics as statistics as my optional in my 11th. I studied economics and statistics both and choose to go with statistics as my full time career because of my interest towards the subject. My friends use to laugh at me for taking commerce group and after that they use to laugh at me for taking Bsc statistics at my Undergrad.Students always thinks that Engeering is the best course. As much as the teachers train the students for JEE and Mains for IIT, they should also create more awareness about Indian Statistical Institute. They have both B math and B stat. Those who take Bsc or Ba or Bcom courses are made inferior by the engeneering students.See Be it any course it all depends on your interest. Those who teases Commerce students are ended up doing MBA after their Engeering degree.Teachers at the school level should create awareness and scope of the subject they are handling so that students will have more choice of choosing their streams."

Is a BCA a better option than a BSC in statistics?,"The main difference between Bsc CS and BCA is Bsc CS is concept oriented, It will teach you the Core Concept of computer science on the other hand BCA being a professional degree is application oriented. You need to have a solid maths background for Bsc CS whereas candidates with Arts and Commerce too can opt for BCA.I would suggest to have a look into the syllabus first as the course content would differ from university to university.Bsc has an edge over BCA when it comes to fees (again it may vary university to university).From employability perspective there is no such major difference between these two degrees . I myself work in Cognizant after completing my BCA and have friends too from Bsc background.Note : Doing a masters degree is preferable after your grads as most of the I.T companies look for BTech/MCA/Msc candidates."
Which is better: BSC statistics or eco hons from DU?,"Hi, this entirely depends on your choice of subjects.Economics is a relatively diverse field, it would give you diverse options to choose from if you choose to pursue it further, e.g., statistics, econometrics, experimental economics, environmental economics, finance, banking.. and a lot more !Where as, i think, statistics is relatively less diverse compared to economics. I don't have much information on the subjects provided if you pursue it after graduation. So search about it and decide where your interest lies. Nothing is good or bad. It all depends on what you like !"
